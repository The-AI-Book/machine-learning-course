<h1>Kernel Course</h1>

Welcome to the **Kernel Course!** 

This course is based on Julien Mairal course on Machine Learning with Kernel Methods. This course is part of the class on kernel methods for machine learning given in the MOSIG/MSIAM master program of University Grenoble-Alpes, and the MVA master of ENS Paris Saclay.

In this course you will learn about:

1. Kernels and RKHS
- Positive Definite Kernels
- Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)
- Examples
- Smoothness functional

2. Kernel tricks
- The kernel trick
- The representer theorem

3. Kernel methods: Supervised Learning
- Kernel ridge regression
- Kernel logistic regression
- Large-mmargin classifiers
- Interlude: convex optimiacion and duality
- Support vector machines

4. Kernel methods: Unsupervised Learning
- Kernel PCA
- Kernel K-meansand spectral clustering
- A quick note on kernel CCA

5. The Kernel Jungle
- Green, Mercer, Herglotz, Bochner and frined
- Kernels for probabilistic models
- Kernels for biological sequences
- Kernels for graphs
- Kernels on graphs

6. Open Problems and Research Topics
- Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL)
- Large-scales learning with kernels
- Foundations of deep learning from a kenerl point of view
